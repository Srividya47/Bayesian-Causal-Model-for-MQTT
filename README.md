# Bayesian-Causal-Model-for-MQTT


To run the project follow the instructions:

1. Install the dependencies
    pip install causalnex ( https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_getting_started/02_install.html)
    pip install  pygraphviz
    pip install dowhy (https://github.com/py-why/dowhy#installation)
2. Attain the dataset can be found in the link : https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/mqtt-iot-ids2020-mqtt-internet-things-intrusion-detection-dataset#files
3. Add the path of the local location of dataset in line number 2.
4. After the dependencies are installed and dataset is attained the jupyter notebooks are now ready to run.
5. There are four jupyter notebooks associated with each attack vector recorded in the dataset.
6.The notebook names are named accordingly, so add the appropriate dataset and run the code.
